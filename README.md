# How to start
After clone this repo, add a .env file to tell where to locate your problems and solutions (locally).
For remote GitHub Action, add `COOKIE` (LeetCode cookie), `PUSH_KEY` (PushDeer notification), `PROBLEM_FOLDER` (where to add problems), `USER` (LeetCode personal page uri).

Example .env file:
```text
PROBLEM_FOLDER="problems"
PUSH_KEY="***[key from PushDeer]"
COOKIE="***[cookie from LeetCode graphql]"
```

install requirements:
```shell
pip install -r requirements
```

And then, **change QUESTION id in [test.py](./test.py)**, and try:
```shell
python3 ./test.py
